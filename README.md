# php-cs-fixer-breki-config

[![Check & fix styling](https://github.com/BrekiTomasson/php-cs-fixer-breki-config/actions/workflows/php_cs_fixer.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/BrekiTomasson/php-cs-fixer-breki-config/actions/workflows/php_cs_fixer.yml)

My own personal preferences for `php-cs-fixer` configuration. This is largely based on legibility and being able to
understand the code quickly when reading it and places no emphasis on being compact, minimalistic or anything like that.

I believe in the old adage that "code is read far more than it is written", so this configuration is themed around that.

This project is also intentionally "light" and not tied to any framework or other third party package(s). The only
required dependency for this project is `php-cs-fixer`, and this will likely continue to be true also in the future.
For this reason, there is no ServiceProvider that integrates the package with Laravel or anything like that, even though
I could consider releasing a separate package that provides a "Laravel wrapper" around this package at some point for
simplicity's sake.

## Installation and Usage

Install the project via `composer` as per usual:

```
composer require --dev brekitomasson/php-cs-fixer-breki-config
```

Once installed into your project, the RuleSet can be used by `php-cs-fixer` by generating your own `.php-cs-fixer` file
with contents similar to the following:

```
<?php

use BrekiTomasson\PhpCsFixer\Config\Exceptions\InvalidPhpVersion;
use BrekiTomasson\PhpCsFixer\Config\Factory;
use BrekiTomasson\PhpCsFixer\Config\RuleSet\Php8;

$ruleSet = new Php8();

try {
    $configuration = Factory::fromRuleSet($ruleSet);
    $configuration->getFinder()->in(__DIR__ . '/' . 'src');
    $configuration->setCacheFile(__DIR__ . '/.build/php-cs-fixer/php-cs-fixer.cache');

    return $configuration;
} catch (InvalidPhpVersion $exception) {
    echo 'Failed to generate php-cs-fixer configuration: ' . $exception->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
}
```

## Future Plans and Ambitions

While I think `php-cs-fixer` is the best tool in the category, there are a couple of other tools out there that also
perform various important functions when it comes to code analysis, linting and the long-term health of PHP projects. I
may be adding more features to this project as time goes on so that it can be used for more than just my `php-cs-fixer`
configuration, although it probably makes sense to handle those configurations in separate packages and have another
package that ties them together somehow.

Also:

- [ ] Add tests and coverage
- [ ] Look into ways of breaking the ruleset down into chunks for more personalization options.

## Thanks, Acknowledgements and Credit

First, a massive thanks to [Fabien Potencier](http://fabien.potencier.org/) and [Dariusz RumiÅ„ski](https://github.com/keradus)
for making `php-cs-fixer`, as well as to the PHP community at large for all your contributions to this project over the
years. I've been a fan of the `php-cs-fixer` project from a distance for a long time and tinkered with configurations
and various ways of integrating it in my own workflow more than I have with any other PHP package. It's to the point
where `php-cs-fixer` is among the first handful of packages that I install, no matter what PHP project I'm working on.

I also want to thank a couple of other developers out there who have made their own `php-cs-fixer` config packages, as
these were very useful to me to read for inspiration of how to structure the code and organize things. This includes:

- [This gist by `laravel-shift`](https://gist.github.com/laravel-shift/cab527923ed2a109dda047b97d53c200), which contains
  their own set of rules for a "Laravel-like" configuration for `php-cs-fixer`.
- [This repo by `matt-allan`](https://github.com/matt-allan/laravel-code-style), which also contains a `php-cs-fixer`
  RuleSet inspired by Laravel.
- [This repo by `ergebnis`](https://github.com/ergebnis/php-cs-fixer-config), which helped me work out a good way of
  organizing the file structure for a project such as this one.
- [This repo by `localheinz`](https://github.com/localheinz/php-cs-fixer-config), also for inspiration on how best to
  structure this kind of project and organize my files.
